# polybar-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of polybar: https://github.com/polybar/polybar

Works like the regular polybar, by default running the appimage does the same as running the regular `polybar` binary. 

If you want to use the `polybar-msg` binary, then you would need to pass the arg `msg` to the appimage, for example: 

`polybar-msg cmd restart` would be `nameofappimage msg cmd restart` instead.
